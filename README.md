🧠 Second Brain

A Personal Knowledge Management System powered by Semantic Search

Second Brain helps you store, search, and retrieve notes intelligently using Embeddings and Pinecone vector search. Unlike plain keyword search, it uses semantic understanding to give you meaningful results.

✨ Features

🔍 Semantic Search – Find notes by meaning, not just keywords.

📒 Smart Note Storage – Save notes with vector embeddings for better retrieval.

⚡ Pinecone Integration – High-performance vector search at scale.

🧠 Embeddings Powered – Leverages LLM embeddings for deep contextual search.


🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Prerequisites

Node.js (>=16) or Python (>=3.9)

Pinecone account + API key

OpenAI (or other embedding provider) API key

2️⃣ Installation
git clone https://github.com/your-username/second-brain.git
cd second-brain
npm install   # or pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Environment Setup

Create a .env file and add:

PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_environment
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

4️⃣ Run the App
npm start   # or python app.py

📖 Usage
Add a Note
POST /notes
{
  "title": "AI in Healthcare",
  "content": "AI is transforming medical imaging, drug discovery, and diagnosis."
}

Search Notes
GET /notes?query="healthcare AI"


🔎 Returns contextually relevant results, even if exact keywords don’t match.

🏗️ Tech Stack
